# Using PersistentVolumes in Kubernetes
## Introduction
PersistentVolumes provide a way to treat storage as a dynamic resource in Kubernetes. This lab will allow you to demonstrate your knowledge of PersistentVolumes. You will mount some persistent storage to a container using a PersistentVolume and a PersistentVolumeClaim.

## Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:
```
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
```
### Create a PersistentVolume That Allows Claim Expansion
Create a custom Storage Class by using `vi localdisk.yml`.

Define the Storage Class by using:
```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 
kind: StorageClass 
metadata: 
  name: localdisk 
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the Storage Class by using kubectl create -f localdisk.yml.

Create the PersistentVolume by using vi host-pv.yml.

Define the PersistentVolume with a size of 1Gi by using:
```
kind: PersistentVolume 
apiVersion: v1 
metadata: 
   name: host-pv 
spec: 
   storageClassName: localdisk
   persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle 
   capacity: 
      storage: 1Gi 
   accessModes: 
      - ReadWriteOnce 
   hostPath: 
      path: /var/output
 ```
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the PersistentVolume by using kubectl create -f host-pv.yml.

Check the status of the PersistenVolume by using kubectl get pv.

### Create a PersistentVolumeClaim
Start creating a PersistentVolumeClaim for the PersistentVolume to bind to by using vi host-pvc.yml.

Define the PersistentVolumeClaim with a size of 100Mi by using:
```
apiVersion: v1 
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim 
metadata: 
   name: host-pvc 
spec: 
   storageClassName: localdisk 
   accessModes: 
      - ReadWriteOnce 
   resources: 
      requests: 
         storage: 100Mi
  ```
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the PersistentVolumeClaim by using kubectl create -f host-pvc.yml.

Check the status of the PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim to verify that they have been bound:
```
kubectl get pv
kubectl get pvc
```
### Create a Pod That Uses a PersistentVolume for Storage
Create a Pod that uses the PersistentVolumeClaim by using vi pv-pod.yml.

Define the Pod by using:
```
apiVersion: v1 
kind: Pod 
metadata: 
   name: pv-pod 
spec: 
   containers: 
      - name: busybox 
        image: busybox 
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo Success! > /output/success.txt; sleep 5; done'] 
 ```
Mount the PersistentVolume to the /output location by adding the following, which should be level with the containers spec in terms of indentation:
```
volumes: 
 - name: pv-storage 
   persistentVolumeClaim: 
      claimName: host-pvc
 ```
In the containers spec, below the command, set the list of volume mounts by using:
```
volumeMounts: 
- name: pv-storage 
  mountPath: /output 
```
Save and exit the file by hitting the ESC key and using :wq.

Finish creating the Pod by using kubectl create -f pv-pod.yml.

Check that the Pod is up and running by using kubectl get pods.

If you wish, you can log in to the worker node and verify the output data by using cat /var/output/success.txt.

## Conclusion
Congratulations — you've completed this hands-on lab!
